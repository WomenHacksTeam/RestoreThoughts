## Inspiration
_Ever unintentionally doubted your abilities? Compared yourself to others? Felt like those around you are achieving greater things than you are, or like you are being left behind while everyone else is climbing a ladder that leads to these amazing schools, internships, or jobs that seem out of your reach? You're not alone; there's a word for that â€” imposter syndrome._

When brainstorming ideas about common mental struggles that still negatively affect people's health, we discovered that imposter syndrome is still prevalent amongst many.

## What it does
Our app aims to help combat imposter syndrome by providing users with a journaling platform and reminding them of big or small accomplishments alike, when they may need the reminders most.

## How we built it
We built it using Flutter and Dart through Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, and Git.

## Challenges we ran into
None of us had worked with Flutter or Dart before so we had to familiarize ourselves with new development environment and syntax. 50% of the team did not have much experience with GitHub or Android Studio and had to research how to set them up and use their different functions. A virtual working environment also made it a bit difficult to discuss potential code issues with each other.

We wanted to include a lot more features, such as authentication, graph, heatmap, highlighting days with biggest accomplishments, and notifications of users' entries detailing their proudest achievements, but we did not have enough time during the hackathon to research and incorporate those into our application. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of learning how to use new tools like Flutter and Android Studio while working together to remotely develop a project within a short time frame.

## What we learned
We all wanted to learn new tools we had not used before, so we learned that Flutter provides both front-end and back-end functionality to build mobile applications.

## What's next for RestoreThoughts
The application will soon include the features mentioned above, along with more advanced features to boost the user's confidence, such as backing up notifications with factual statistics about how every small accomplishment eventually leads to great results.
